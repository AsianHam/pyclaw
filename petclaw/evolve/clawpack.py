Module containg the PetClaw solvers

This module contains the pure and wrapped PetClaw solvers.  All 
PetClaw solvers inherit from the :class:`ClawSolver` superclass which in turn 
inherits from the :class:`~petclaw.evolve.solver.Solver` superclass.  As such, 
the only solver classes that should be directly used should be the 
dimensionally dependent ones such as :class:`PetClawSolver1D`.
