The $CLAW/amrclaw directory contains a version of Clawpack that uses
adaptive mesh refinement (AMR).

See :ref:`setrun_amrclaw` for a description of the run-time parameters
needed by AMRClaw and how to set them.

The refinement strategy and criteria are described in :ref:`amr_strategy`.

Several examples can be found from :ref:`apps`, look for ones with an *amr*
subdirectory.
