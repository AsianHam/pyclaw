PyClaw and PetClaw should be considered beta software at present.  Major changes are
being made to the user interface and internal structure.  A first release is expected
at the end of 2011.

Some major future plans include 

    * Incorporation of the 3D Clawpack algorithms
    * Adaptive mesh refinement
    * Additional solver algorithms
